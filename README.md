# Forget
An app that helps you to remember things

# Download the app:
**Since gogle play protect will block this app from installing (I don't know why, you can check the code by yourself I am 100% sure that except the key of the signed apk , everything is the same as the project in the zip file.) , I suggest you to install it in the files by google app since I tested it and unlike installing from the browser , the pop-up of the play protect will show instead of crashing the whole package installer.**
